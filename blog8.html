By neutralizing free radicals CGA serves as a stalwart defender, shielding liver cells from the ravages of damage and degeneration. Moreover, CGA's anti-inflammatory prowess extends a protective mantle over the liver, fortifying it against the deleterious effects of various hepatotoxic substances and conditions, thus bolstering its resilience and vitality.
